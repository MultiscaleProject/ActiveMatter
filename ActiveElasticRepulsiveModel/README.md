# Active Elastic Repulsive Model

Author: Gouzheng Lin, Amir Shee, and Cristi√°n Huepe

We consider a dense sheet of active Brownian disks with elastic repulsive forces that act on their positions and
orientations. Each disk can move along its heading direction or rotate about a center
of rotation located at a distance R behind its barycenter.

$\begin{align}
&U_{ij}=\begin{cases}\f{k}{2} \left(|\rv_{ij}| - l_0\right)^2~~\text{if}~~|\rv_{ij}|\leq l_0\\
0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}$
