### Project Overview

This repository provides the code and resources for simulating **quenched disorder (QD)** in dense active systems, as introduced in our paper. The model represents **self-propelled polar disks** with non-isotropic rotational and translational dynamics, which interact through linear repulsive forces. These interactions give rise to a novel **noise-induced quenched disorder state**, observed at intermediate noise levels, where agents become jammed in random orientations with small fluctuations around their fixed positions.

The simulations explore various phases, including:
1. **Moving Order (MO)** - Agents align in a common direction.
2. **Dynamic Disorder (DD)** - Headings continuously change due to rotational diffusion.
3. **Quenched Disorder (QD)** - Intermediate noise induces jamming with fluctuating headings.
