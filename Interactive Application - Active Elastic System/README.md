# Agent-Based System Simulation

This repository hosts an interactive application modeling an **Active Elastic System**, where self-propelled particles interact through spring-like connections. The system showcases emergent collective motion based on elasticity-driven dynamics, inspired by swarming behaviors observed in nature, such as fish schools, bird flocks, and bacterial colonies.

The project is an interactive simulation of an agent-based system implemented using p5.js. The simulation allows users to create, manipulate, and connect agents within a dynamic environment, adjusting various parameters that influence the agents' behavior and the overall system dynamics. The main goal is to provide a visual and interactive way to explore how agents and their interactions evolve over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Create, move, and connect agents using a variety of controls and buttons.
- **Elastic Interactions**: Particles are connected by virtual springs, and their dynamics are driven by elasticity rather than alignment-based interactions like in traditional models (e.g., Vicsek model).
- **Customizable Parameters**: The application allows users to adjust parameters like spring constants, damping coefficients, noise levels, and more.
- **Dynamic Grid Movement**: Move the grid and adjust agent positions accordingly to explore different sections of the canvas.
- **Real-time Visualization**: The system displays real-time collective behaviors, and users can interact with the simulation, adding/removing agents or adjusting grid properties.
- **Agent System**: Agents can be dragged, repositioned, or connected/disconnected dynamically, with spring lengths resetting based on agent movement.
- **Export and Import Functionality**: Save and load system configurations (agents and connections) as CSV files.


## Theoretical Background

The **Active Elastic System** is based on the work presented in the paper "Elasticity-Based Mechanism for the Collective Motion of Self-Propelled Particles with Springlike Interactions" by Ferrante et al. (2013). This model introduces a novel mechanism where collective motion emerges from elastic deformations between self-propelled agents, without requiring explicit alignment interactions.

### Core Equations:

- **Position Update**:  
  $\mathbf{x}_i = v_0 \hat{n}_i + \alpha \left[ (\mathbf{F}_i + D_r \xi_r) \cdot \hat{n}_i \right] \hat{n}_i$
  
  Where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the position of agent $i$, $v_0$ is the self-propulsion velocity, $\mathbf{F}_i$ represents the spring-like force on the agent, and $D_r$ adds random fluctuations.

This model diverges from traditional alignment-based collective motion models by utilizing position-based interactions, resulting in an active crystal-like state where agents move coherently.

## Main Components

### Global Variables
- **Interface Elements**: 
  - `controlPanel`: Manages the display and interaction areas for controls.
  - `buttons`: Handles user interface buttons for creating, removing, and connecting agents.
  - `importExport`: Manages importing and exporting data.

- **System State Variables**: 
  - `myXSystem`: Manages the collection of agents and connections.
  - `gridReferencePosition`: Tracks the position of the grid reference point.

- **Simulation Parameters**:
  - `_r`, `_v0`, `_alpha`, `_beta`, `_dTheta`, `_k`: Sliders controlling various agent and connection properties such as radius, speed, force constants, etc.
  - `updateParameters`: A flag indicating when to update the system with new parameter values.

### Key Functions

- **`setup()`**: Initializes the canvas, creates the interface elements, and sets up the main agent system.
