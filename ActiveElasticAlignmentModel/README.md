### Model Overview

This repository presents a minimal model for **active agents** that interact through a combination of elastic attraction-repulsion forces and an alignment mechanism. The agents are connected to their neighbors via linear springs, anchored at a distance \( R \) from their center of rotation, allowing for flexible yet controlled interactions.

The model exhibits a noise-induced **order-disorder transition**, which is discontinuous for small values of \( R \) and continuous for larger \( R \). This transition provides insight into the dynamic behavior of various real-world systems.
