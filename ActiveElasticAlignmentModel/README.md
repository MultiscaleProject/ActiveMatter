# Active Elastic Alignment Model

Author: Gouzheng Lin and Cristi√°n Huepe

We introduce a minimal model for active agents that undergoes attraction-repulsion elastic force with an alignment mechanism. The agents are connected to their neighbors by linear springs attached at a distance of $R$ from their center of rotation.

The model results in order-disorder noise-induced transition, which is discontinuous for small $R$ and continuous for large $R$.

Real-world systems such as active membranes and groups of animals to the robotic systems can realize through this active-mechanical model.
